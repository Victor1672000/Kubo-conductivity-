The file contains the scripts needed to calculate the Kubo conductivity of static Hamiltonians

The main functions can be found in the file "vector_wise_conductivity_efficient.jl"
The files "Read_TB_Hamiltonian.jl" and "TB_Hamiltonian_noise.jl" contain the functions required to import Hamiltonians parameterised via TB
An example of how the function work can be found in the file "example_file_conductivity_calc.jl"
